Module 17 Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Overview of the analysis.


-  In 2019, more than 19 million Americans had at least one unsecured personal loan. That's a record-breaking number! Personal lending is growing faster than credit card, auto, mortgage, and even student debt. With such incredible growth, FinTech firms are storming ahead of traditional loan processes. By using the latest machine learning techniques, these FinTech firms can continuously analyze large amounts of data and predict trends to optimize lending. 

-  Use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.
 

### Results:

- Balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. 
 
Balanced accuracy score for deliverable 1 and 2 ranged to an unimpressive 0.5442166848817717 to 0.662394124702461
Balanced accuracy score for deliverable 3 is improved to 0.7877672625306695 and 0.925427358175101, leading to an improved model.


Below photos illustrate the least impressive and the best model.

# Summary:

1- Machine learning utilizes different techniques to achieve the best results such as undersampling, resampling, accuracy matrixes, calsifiers etc. While results are not guaranteed from one model to the other some of the techniques can prove more effective.

2- In our case EasyEnsembleClassifier was able to improve the results of the model dramatically, improving accuracy, confusion matrix and imbalanced classification reports.
